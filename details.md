#### An overview for system design from absolute basics to advanced:

1. Learn the basics of system design principles: Start by learning the basics of system design principles such as scalability, fault tolerance, availability, and performance. Understand how these principles apply to the design of large-scale systems.

2. Learn the basics of distributed systems: Distributed systems are composed of multiple nodes that work together to achieve a common goal. Learn about the basics of distributed systems, including message passing, distributed consensus, and distributed data storage.

3. Study real-world examples of systems: Study real-world examples of systems that have been designed to solve similar problems to what you are working on. Analyze the architecture of these systems and try to understand the design decisions that were made.

4. Learn about design patterns: Design patterns are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. Learn about common design patterns such as the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, the Singleton pattern, and the Observer pattern.

5. Learn about scalability: Scalability is the ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of work or traffic. Learn about different scaling techniques such as horizontal scaling and vertical scaling.

6. Learn about caching: Caching is the process of storing frequently accessed data in memory to improve performance. Learn about different caching strategies such as in-memory caching and distributed caching.

7. Learn about load balancing: Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers to improve performance and availability. Learn about different load balancing techniques such as round-robin and least connections.

8. Learn about data storage: Data storage is an important aspect of system design. Learn about different data storage technologies such as relational databases, NoSQL databases, and object storage.

9. Learn about messaging systems: Messaging systems are used to facilitate communication between different components of a distributed system. Learn about different messaging systems such as Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ.

10. Learn about microservices: Microservices are a way of designing complex systems as a collection of small, independent services that communicate with each other over a network. Learn about the benefits and challenges of using microservices.

11. Learn about cloud computing: Cloud computing is a model for delivering computing resources over the internet. Learn about different cloud computing services such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).

12. Learn about security: Security is an important aspect of system design. Learn about different security mechanisms such as encryption, access control, and authentication.

13. Practice designing systems: Once you have a good understanding of system design principles and have studied real-world examples, start practicing designing systems yourself. You can start with simple systems and work your way up to more complex ones.

14. Get feedback: Share your designs with others and get feedback. This can be from peers, mentors, or online communities. Getting feedback from others can help you improve your designs and learn from others' experiences.

15. Continuously learn and improve: System design is a continuous learning process. Keep up-to-date with the latest technologies and best practices, and always look for opportunities to improve your designs.
